    biography: `
    Bria Woodard is a senior at Howard University where she majors in Biology and minors in Chemistry and Spanish. Within the Molecular Imaging Lab Summer Internship Program, Bria is working in the Pritchett Lab to understand and uncover cognitive cerebellar function. Within the lab, she aims to understand the correlation between the cerebellum, locus coeruleus, and medial prefrontal cortex with the Grin2A gene.
    <br/><br/>
    Bria's research interests primarily lie in neurological functions, biological functions, and biotechnology. She aspires to be a physician-scientist and hopes to find undiscovered and novel neurological pathways during her internship that can ultimately improve the lives of several neurological patients. A fun fact about Bria is that she is student-athlete at Howard University on the Bison's Women Volleyball Team.
